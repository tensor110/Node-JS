Node is single threaded
No matter how many cores you have, node only uses a single core of your CPU
This is fine for 1/0 operations but if the code has long running and CPU intensive operations, your application might struggle from a performance point of view
The cluster module enables the creation of child processes (also called workers) that run simultaneously
All created workers share the same server port

Master is only in charge of the workers
Workers are in charge of handling incoming requests, reading files etc
Each worker gets its own event loop, memory, and V8 instance
