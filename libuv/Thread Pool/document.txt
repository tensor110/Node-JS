Every method in node.js that has the "sync" suffix always runs on the main thread and is blocking

A few async methods like fs.readFile and crypto.pbkdf2 run on a separate thread in Iibuv's thread pool. They do run synchronously in their own thread but as far as the main thread is concerned, it appears as if the method is running asynchronously

Libuv's thread pool has 4 threads

By increasing the thread pool size, we are able to improve the total time taken to
run multiple calls of an asynchronous method like pbkdf2

Increasing the thread pool size can help with performance but that is limited by the
number of available CPU cores

Although both crypto.pbkdf2 and https.request are asynchronous, https.request method does not seem to use the thread pool
https.request does not seem to be affected by the number of CPU cores either
It is because https.request is a network input/output operation and not a CPU bound operation. It does not use the thread pool
